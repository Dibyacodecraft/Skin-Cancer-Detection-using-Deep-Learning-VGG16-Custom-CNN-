# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-VGG16-Custom-CNN-
This project is focused on the detection of skin cancer (malignant vs. benign lesions) using deep learning techniques, leveraging both pre-trained VGG16 architecture and a custom CNN model.




 ðŸ“Š Overview

- Utilizes image metadata in CSV format (train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv)
- Preprocesses input images (resize, normalize)
- Trains and evaluates deep learning models
- Outputs confusion matrix, ROC curve, accuracy, sensitivity & specificity

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Pre-trained VGG16 from Keras
- Custom CNN trained on melanoma dataset

## ðŸ“¦ Files Included

- SkinCancerDetection.py: Main script
- SkinCancerDetectionFinal.ipynb: Notebook version
- labels.csv, train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv: Dataset metadata
- Explaination.txt: Full breakdown and code walkthrough
- settings.json: VSCode UI customization
